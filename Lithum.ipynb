        "In *Eumenides* and *Symposium*, debate scenes serve to distinguish each work's differnt perception on the nature of truth. *Eumenides* treats truth as a subjective commodity, while *Symposium* treats it objectively. However, while the books denote these two notions, how do these books arrive at these conclusions?\n",
        "\n",
        "This innteractive game will illustrate the thinking *behind* how these two different notions arise by encouraging you to adopt each mindset. This activity consists of a game where a set of numbers is generated according to pre-defined rule/rules. Your job is to determine the \"truth\" (i.e the pre-defined rule(s)) by adopting either of these two notions of truth and seeing what the process of truth-determination looks and feels like. For example, if the set of numbers is 2, 4, 6 (in that order), you may think the rule for these numbers is that \n",

        "In the subjective portion, you were only given a limited set of data. This was to reflect how, in the reality, many people do not have infinite access of all forms of information in the world. For example, in a real court case, the jury/judge are not actively present at the crime, so those people would only get bits and pieces of the whole situation through witness who testify about the events that occurred. In fact, even witnesses may not have a complete understanding, which is why multiple witnesses are often necessary in a trial with high stakes. Given that this is the reality of our world, people can only make decisions/\"judgements of truth\" based on limited data. Furthermore, in this game, each computer player also came up with a rule that matched the numbers they were presented (if you are interested in seeing the other computer's numbers, click \"Show code\" under the first cell titled \"Click arrow to start\"). Therefore, this game helps illustrate how *context* is important to truth-determination when information is limited. In addition, notice how through your own understanding of the truth (i.e. the numbers you were given), you were still able to comment on other computer player's understanding, and arrive to a conclusion by popular vote, despite only having a limited information individually. By choice, the game was designed for you to not see other players numbers to reflect, how in the *Eumenidies*, each party is unable to adopt or understand the other's perspectives (Apollo + Orestes vs. Furies).  Finally, the truth was collectively decided upon by majority vote. Despite its *imperfections*, with some players voting for or against the truth, this rule now became the truth for the group. This is to reflect how the *Eumenidies* portrays truths as collectively determined. It is simillar to the notion behind the question, if a tree falls in a forest, but no one sees/hears it fall, does it really fall? Societal determined truths may be far off from the reality of the situation, but they **are** the truth for the people who collectively agree to it. Even in this game, it is possible that the truth that was determined as a collective was actually quite far off from the real truth. However, if the game never presented you with the actual truth, there would have been no way of knowing if your answer was truly very wrong. \n",

        "In the objective portion of the game, you were given an unlimited number of attempts to refine your rule. It is **only** because of this infinite access to information that you could even begin to introduce a process to your guesses. This is to reflect the *Symposium's* emphasis on using the debate as a space where questions are encouraged, since they provide a way to logically discern the truth. The goal of iterative process of asking and receiving feedback was to encourage the player to adopt a Socratic method of approaching a truth since they have essentially unlimited access to information. In contrast to the previous part, since the player can see a lot of different possibilities and, crucially, recieve feedback on it, the player can adopt a *strategy* (i.e a logical way of testing out ideas) that allows for a refinement in ideas (this was also the reason why the objective game should be played after the subjective game). Then, the process of testing the idea, analogous to others scrutinizing your rules (i.e Socrates questioning Agathon or Diotima questioing Socrates, points out flaws in the players way of thinking, allowing for another chance to go back and refine their ideas through morre logical testing. \n",

        "The first goal of this project was to explain why different notions of truth arise in the first place in the books. One reason behind why the books treat truth differently revolves around the concept of practicalty. For example, the subjective portion of the game should have taken the player a much shorter time than objective portion. Thus, this shows that accepting that truth must be subjective, and creating a debate prcoess to reflect this, is more practical in a real-world, low-information setting. In Orestes' trial, the jury does not have limitless knowledge or time, so they must find a way to efficently, yet accurately (since the stakes are high) determine truth. Thus, this portion of the game illustrates that the *Eumenidies* portrays truth as subjective because it is practical to do so, given that its world is riddled with uncertainity and differing perspectives on Orestes' actions and explains why the text treats truth as subjective. On the other hand, the characters in *Symposium* are conceptualized within a frame narrative that is once removed from the actual world and seem to have plenty to time to discuss matters. This is why they are able to undergo the same process of systematic testing and collaboration. In the game, the player's guess was likely much closer to the actual truth than in the subjective portion of the game, but was harder/slower to reach (i.e had a practical cost associated with it). \n",

        "The second goal of this project was to, more philosophically, understand truth and debate in a more general sense. The two texts deal with truth-determination and debate where humans are the ones testing and reasoning ideas. However, in this case, a pre-programmed algorithm was present in both the subjective and objective games. Thus, this project shows the truth-determination doesn't solely have to involve two humans, it can invovle a human and a machine. Especially considering how AI is becoming more advanced and its capabilities expanding to include understanding spoken and writeen language, a future where machines and humans collectively work together to determine truth may be possible. This future would mean that we don't have to sacrifice practicality for accuracy or vice versa, as was the case with the subjective and objective approaches, because of a computer's ability to efficently parse large amounts of data. AI, which could think subjectively like a human, but also have the ability efficiently process lots of data would essentially, lessening the impractical nature of the treating truth as an entity. In essence, this project should encourage the players to realize that they were able to determine a truth based on interactions with a machine, giving insight into the fact that truth-determination is not just an ability that is present in all humans (for example, as the *Eumenidies* portrays it), but also for machines."
